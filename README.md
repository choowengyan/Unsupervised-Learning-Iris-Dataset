### Unsupervised Learning on Iris Dataset 

#### Background
Given the iris dataset, if we knew that there were k types of iris, but did not have access to a taxonomist to label them
 - we could try a clustering task: split the observations into well-separated group called clusters.

#### Dataset
Use the iris dataset from scikit-learn

#### Tasks
1.	Write the code to solve the clustering task using scikit-learn 
2.	Write a short report detailing implementation, experiments and analysis in the Jupyter notebook.
3.	Test the clustering with different possible values of k. (try different algorithm) 
4.	Determine the best possible value of k and show how the ability to determine that this is the best value for k.
5.	Create a set slides with the highlights of Jupyter notebook report. Explain the unsupervised machine learning process, model building, evaluation and conclusion.
